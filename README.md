## About

In this project I developed a trivia game in pair programming. We used React, Redux and Scrum methods.
The game uses an API and has a scoring system based on correct answers and time taken to answer.
The best local players are placed in a ranking system with local storage.

## Techs

React-Redux Integration (Store, Action Creators, Reducers)
API Consumption
Local Storage
Crypto Hash keys via Crypto.js
Materialize CSS to Styles

## Design

The design was chosen to simulate a 90's trivia game with lots of colors, as the 90's demand :D.
